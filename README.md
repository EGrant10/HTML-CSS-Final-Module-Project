# HTML & CSS: Final Module Project

This is my final project for the HTML & CSS section. This is a personal landing page that gives information about me and also shows some of the work I have completed so far in the course.

# How to View

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/EGrant10/HTML-CSS-Final-Module-Project.git
2. Open 'index.html' in your web browser.

# What I Learned

This assingment was great for me to bring together all the things I've learned in this unit. Everything from creative concept design to complete interactive page development. I had to use multiple reactive features to make the page adaptable. The biggest challenge and learning making this was the CSS styling. I think the HTML at this point is pretty straight forward but the styling is more complex and can get confusing on adjusting to the appropriate format.
