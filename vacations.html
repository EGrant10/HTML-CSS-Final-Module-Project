        <h1>Traveling the World</h1>
        <div class="vaca-intro">
          <p>
            One of the most beneficial things that have come from going out on
            my own is my eyes opening to how big the world is. I think in
            college you have the idea that it would be cool to travel but you
            don't think much about why you want to do it. Even more so most
            people never even actually take that first step. The past 4 years of
            traveling I've done since college has not only allowed me to meet
            incredible people, but has showed me just how beautiful God's world
            is and how much I should appreciate it by exploring it. There is so
            much difference in culture in different places and I love
            experiencing it first hand. Traveling has become a passion of mine
            that has even made me want to live abroad at some point. Below I'm
            going to recap some of my best trips so far.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                In 2023, I spontaneously decided to take a trip for my 25th
                birthday to Japan. I decided I wanted to make sure I got the
                most out this experience so I decided to go with a travel
                company I had heard about in college. Basically you sign up and
                when you arrive to your destination you meet up with other solo
                travelers along with a tour guide. It was incredible to
                experience Japan in this way. Our tour guide was native to Japan
                so he knew all the best spots to take us to. We went to Tokyo,
                Kyoto, and Osaka over the course of 10 days.
              </p>
              <p>
                While in Japan I fell in love with the culture there. As a
                naturally more introverted person myself, I resonated with the
                calmness and respect everyone showed each other. Their culture
                is so rich in history in uniqueness that it made every thing I
                did there so intersting. From visiting different temples, to
                seeing Mt. Fuji, to even just going to the Mcdonalds there. I
                think people often have a hesitency to go to countries like
                Japan because it is so homogenous, and I obviously stuck out
                there but everyone was so friendly with me. I not only felt the
                respect in my interactions but watching how Japanese people
                interacted with each other. Now I'm not naive enough to beleive
                that there are never any disagreements or crime that happens
                there, but the tone of the society was very different from here
                in America. I already have plans to go back this coming year and
                would even like to live there for a short stint some day.

              In 2024, I used the same company I had used for my Japan trip and
              went to Greece. This was a little different though, I invited one
              of my best friends from highschool to go with me this time and we
              had a great time. We went to Athens, Mykonos, Paros, and
              Santorini. It was pretty cool seeing such an ancient country that
              has had such a huge impact on architecture, art, and philosophy.
              The real highlight of this trip though was the food. I had the
              best food of my life in Greece. From fresh seafood right by the
              water, lamb, souvlaki, and of course the taziki and pita. It was
              all incredible and I would go back just for the food alone.

              This year I went to Cozumel, Mexico with my mom on a cruise. This
              was your typicl mother son trip and honestly it was very chill.
              I've been away from home for 4 years now so our dynamic is still
              mother son but we're both adults now so it's a little different. I
              love getting to introduce her to things that she typically
              wouldn't do, like I signed us up for a cave hike in the cenotes. I
              think we hiked something like 3 miles completely in their
              underground cave system. At some points we were just walking in
              knee deep water and other points we were swimming where our feet
              couldn't touch the ground. The whole trip was a lot of fun and I'm
              grateful for the time with my mom.
